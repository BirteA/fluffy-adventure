#Description: Lnd_Metmax

Input files are generated by metmax-export, subsequently after processing 
and annotation of the files in chromatof. 

Files were exported into txt-files and uploaded in metmax twice:
	(1)	options: retention analysis
	(2) options: isotope concentrator with metmax_73-template uploaded in metabolite masses

Both matrices were copied into independent Excel-Sheets and saved in: input/metmax 
(subsequently of MTXQCinit, that creates the folder structure):
	(1) peakarea_samples.csv
	(2) mz73_metmax.csv

This project does not include stable isotope labelling.

Have a look at this setup in case you want to understand:
* How to use MTXQCpart4 (Metmax integration)
* Which input files are required for MTXQCpart4
* Determination of calibration curves based on our Quant-Mix
* How to define quant-standards in your annotation table
* How to define blood samples in Sample_extracts.csv
* How to adopt your conversion_list to use non-database defined metabolite names, unknowns etx.


How to use:
* Create a new Rproject at a convenient place on your computer, 

* Copy all files and folders of your MTXQCvX-archive into the Rproject

* Run MTXQCinit (Knit as html) - define a subfolder: test_project

* Copy input files accordingly to example dataset, including annotation.csv, Sample_extracts.csv

* Knit the following reports in that order and with the following parameter:
